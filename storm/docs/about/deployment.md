Storm clusters are easy to deploy, requiring a minimum of setup and configuration to get up and running. Storm's out of the box configurations are suitable for production. Read more about how to deploy a Storm cluster [here](/documentation/Setting-up-a-Storm-cluster.html).

If you're on EC2, the [storm-deploy](https://github.com/nathanmarz/storm-deploy) project can provision, configure, and install a Storm cluster from scratch at just the click of a button.

Additionally, Storm is easy to operate once deployed. Storm has been designed to be [extremely robust](/about/fault-tolerant.html) â€“ the cluster will just keep on running, month after month.

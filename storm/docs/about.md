Storm is a <a href="/about/free-and-open-source.html">free and open source</a> distributed realtime computation system. Storm makes it easy to reliably process unbounded streams of data, doing for realtime processing what Hadoop did for batch processing. Storm is <a href="/about/simple-api.html">simple</a>, can be used with <a href="/about/multi-language.html">any programming language</a>, and is a lot of fun to use!

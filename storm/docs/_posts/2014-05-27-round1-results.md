title: Logo Contest - Round 1 Results
author: P. Taylor Goetz
---

Round one of the Apache Storm logo contest is now complete and was a great success. We received votes from 7 PPMC members as well as 46 votes from the greater Storm community.

We would like to extend a very special thanks to all those who took the time and effort to create and submit a logo proposal. We would also like to thank everyone who voted.

## Results ##
The Storm PPMC and community votes were closely aligned, with the community vote resolving a PPMC tie for the 3rd finalist as shown in the result table below.

The three finalists entering the final round are:

 * [No. 6 - Alec Bartos](/2014/04/23/logo-abartos.html)
 * [No. 9 - Jennifer Lee](/2014/04/29/logo-jlee1.html)
 * [No. 10 - Jennifer Lee](/2014/04/29/logo-jlee2.html)
 
Congratulations Alec and Jennifer!

Stay tuned for the final vote, which will be announced shortly.

We are pleased to announce that Apache Storm version 0.9.3 has reached the release candidate stage.  The latest release is 0.9.3-rc1.  We are moving closer to the GA release, so this is a good time to give this new 0.9.3 version a try!

Storm 0.9.3 is a maintenance release with bug fixes and better stability as summarized in the [0.9.3 changelog](https://github.com/apache/storm/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).  On top of that version 0.9.3 continues to improve the integration with [Apache Kafka](http://kafka.apache.org/) as well as the [documentation of the core spout and Trident spout for Kafka](https://github.com/apache/storm/blob/master/external/storm-kafka/README.md), which will provide our users with the best Kafka connectivity for Storm to date.

We heartily encourage you to [test the 0.9.3 release candidate](http://storm.apache.org/downloads.html) and provide your feedback regarding any issues via [our mailing lists](http://storm.apache.org/community.html), which is an easy and valuable way to contribute back to the Storm community and to help us moving to an official 0.9.3 release.  You can find the [0.9.3 release candidate in our Downloads section](http://storm.apache.org/downloads.html).
